   <p style="font-family: -apple-system;">Filip Pizlo‚Äôs blog post on GC is great at explaining the novelties of JSC‚Äôs GC, and also positions it within the context of various GC schemes in academia and industry. However, as someone with little GC background, I felt the blog alone insufficient for me to get a solid understanding of the algorithm and the motivation behind the design. Through digging into the code, and with some great help from Saam Barati, one of JSC‚Äôs lead developers, I wrote up this blog post in the hope that it can help more people understand this beautiful design.</p>

   <ul>
      <li>CompleteSubspace: this is a segregated allocator responsible for allocating small objects (max size about 8KB).</li>
      <li>PreciseAllocation: this is used to handle large allocations that cannot be handled by the CompleteSubspace allocator[8].</li>
      <li>IsoSubspace: each IsoSubspace is used to allocate objects of a fixed type with a fixed size.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <ol>
      <li>Most objects collected by the GC are young objects (died when they are still in eden), so an eden GC (which only collects the eden) is sufficient to reclaim most newly allocated memory.
      </li>
      <li>Pointers from old space to eden is much rarer than pointers from eden to old space or pointers from eden to eden, so an eden GC‚Äôs runtime is approximately linear to the size of the eden, as it only needs to start from a small subset of the old space. This implies that the cost of GC can be amortized by the cost of allocation.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>IsoSubspace is mostly a simplified CompleteSubspace, so we will ignore it for the purpose of this post. CompleteSubspace is the one that handles the common case: small allocations, and PreciseAllocation is mostly the rare slow path for large allocations.</p>

   <h2>Generational GC Basics</h2>
   <p>In JSC‚Äôs generational GC model, the heap consists of a small ‚Äúnew space‚Äù (eden), holding the newly allocated objects, and a large ‚Äúold space‚Äù holding the older objects that have survived one GC cycle. Each GC cycle is either an eden GC or a full    GC. New objects are allocated in the eden. When the eden is full, an eden GC is invoked to garbage-collect the unreachable objects in eden. All the surviving objects in eden are then considered to be in the old space[11]. To reclaim objects in the old space, a full GC is needed.
   </p>
   <pre class="language-js" data-line="3"><code>let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = (age < 18) ?
   () => alert('Hello!') :
   () => alert("Greetings!");

welcome();</code></pre>
   <p>The effectiveness of the above scheme <code>() => console.log("hi")</code> relies on the so-called ‚Äúgenerational hypothesis‚Äù:</p>
   <p>Pointers from old space to eden is much rarer than pointers from eden to old space or pointers from eden to eden, so an eden GC‚Äôs runtime is approximately linear to the size of the eden, as it only needs to start from a small subset of the old space. This implies that the cost of GC can be amortized by the cost of allocation.</p>
   
   <div class="label">Memory allocators and GCs are tightly coupled by nature ‚Äì the allocator allocates memory to be reclaimed by the GC, and the GC frees memory to be reused by the allocator. In this section, we will briefly introduce JSC‚Äôs memory allocators.

   At</div>
   <h3>Practically every GC scheme uses some kind of metadata to track which objects are alive</h3>
   <p>The inlined metadata cellState is easy to access for the mutator thread (the thread executing JavaScript code), since it is just a field in the object. However, it has bad memory locality for the GC and allocators, which need to quickly traverse through all the metadata of all objects in some block owned by CompleteSubspace (which is the common case).
   <figure>
      <blockquote>
         <p>Outlined metadata have the opposite performance characteristics: they are more expensive to access for the mutator thread, but since they are aggregated into bitvectors and stored in the block footer of each block, GC and allocators can traverse them really fast.</p>
         <p>So JSC keeps both inlined and outlined metadata to get the better of both worlds: the mutator thread‚Äôs fast path will only concern the inlined cellState, while the GC and allocator logic can also take advantage of the memory locality of the outlined bits isNew and isMarked.</p>

   <p>Of course, the cost of this is a more complex design‚Ä¶ so we have to unfold it bit by bit.
